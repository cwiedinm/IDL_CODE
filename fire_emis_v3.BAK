 ;
 ; This program then calculates the fire emissions for
 ; North America for 2002
 ;
 ; Created by originally Christine, 05/13/03

 ; SEPTEMBER 15, 2004: Edited to only bring in 1 file  (that contain all points for 1 year)
 ;  The point data has been supplied by Brad Quayle at USFS.
 ;  In that table is also the underlying GLC code, LCT code, % tree, Herbaceous, and bare coverage
 ;  The emissions here are determined purely by these input Data
 ;  NO fuels information or FEPs algorithms will be used here!
 ;  All emissions factors, fuel loadings etc. wil be read in from outside files.
 ;  NOTHING is to be hardwired, if possible
 ; NOVEMBER 22-24, 2004: Edited by Christine to work with 2004 data
 ;  Edits are noted within the code; THIS VERSION DOES NOT INCLUDE FEPS CALCULATIONS!
 ; December 9, 2004; Edited code to include speciated VOC based on Louisa's code for MOZART
 ; December 13, 2004:
 ;      Am putting the speciated VOC eimssions in the Gabyfile.pro (since they are only scale factors
 ; March 02, 2005:
 ;    Editing fire module to include area-specific emissions factors (i.e. for Alaska)
 ;      NOT DONE YET
 ; April 6, 2005
 ;      edited emission factor table (for PM2.5) based on Chris Geron's Comments to the manuscript
 ; April 12, 2005: Edited to take care of GLC = -9999, VCF = 253, etc based on evaluation (see EXCEL sheet
 ;      in the folder with Brad's new data
 ;  checked output and all seems to be calculating properly
 ; July 26, 2005: This version was edited (from Version 5.9) to calculate the emissions for the U.S.
 ;  using the NFDRS data (reprocessed by Angie this week).
 ; August 24, 2005: Edited code for NFDRS
 ;   waiting on Canadian fuel loadings
 ; August 25, 2005: Still working on code to incorporate FCCS, Canadian Fuels, and NOAA MODIS fuels
 ;  Created input files in GIS: All shape files are in D:\Christine\WORK\wildfire\EPA_EI\ANGIE\July05\
 ; Sepetmber 1, 2005: redid the fuel loadings for the GLC class... now have total fuel loadings (ave., high and low)
 ;         have user chose which loads to run
 ;      fraction of hervaceous and woody fuels are the average of the values for the approproate class from the FCCS
 ;   *** Note: until today, the NFDRS fuel loads were too high by a factor of 10. This is corrected
 ;   *** Note: Today, changed the Fuel loadings and emission factors for the GLC classes
 ; September 2, 2005:
 ;      - redid the emission factors for the GLC classes (i.e. PM10 > PM2.5, changed CO2 EF for forest)
 ;      - rerun model with extension 090205 for drought and no drought scenario
 ;      - added extension for output files... so that it's consistent.
 ; September 6, 2005: Edited fuel loadings for temperate forests and rerun model
 ; September 14, 2005: Edited code to include calculations with FCCS Fuels
 ; September 15, 2005: Edited code to include calculations with MODIS-derived fuels (from XYZ, NOAA)
 ;       NOAA Fuels joined to model input files on 09/09/2005 by Christine
 ;       - results using NOAA FUELS are a factor of 100 low (biomass burned way too low)
 ;       - correcting how? Units were incorrect... fixed this in code
 ; May 10, 2006: runnig for he 2005 fire points that Brad just sent to me. Not running the inputs
 ;      with any other fuel loadings except the glc stuff;
 ; June 8, 2006: running the 2006 points that Brad sent to me, merged with the
 ;  reclassed VCF NA_ae4 rasters
 ; July 25, 2006: reran the 2006 data for Jerome (wasn't sure what was done on June 8 2006)
 ;   edited to do glc calculations only
 ; September 07, 2006: running the 2006 data downloaded from the RSAC for the Year to date
 ;   ***NOTE!!: Changed default glc type from grasslands to either forest, shrub or grass
 ;      depending on the tree cover
 ; September 22, 2006: Running with the RSAC downloads up through today (for project with
 ;      Schimel and Jason Neff
 ; October 02, 2006: running again with RSAC downloads up through today (for project
 ;      with Schimel and Neff). Note, changing output file name...
 ; January 11, 2007: Edited code to include HCN emissions (from Yokelson and others)
 ; January 23, 2007: Updated HCN Emission Factors and added CH3CN
 ; January 24, 2007: Updated with Hg Emission Factors from Hans
 ; April 04, 2007: Updated with new Hg Emissions from Hans. Have low, ave., and high emission factors
 ;  (finished editing 04/05/2007. Now have a choice of which Hg Emission factors to use
 ;  and it assigns the forested ecosystems at latitudes > 50N a boreal EF)
 ; MAy 08, 2007: on April 04, 2007, the fuel loading was set to the HIGH fuel loadings. So, all estimates in April were
 ; 		too high. I reset this to 1 today.
 ;		renamed the version to Fire_emisv2.pro
 ;		removed a lot of the comments to clean up code.
 ; September 10, 2007: Renamed this code Fire_emis_MC
 ; 			This is for year 2006, reprocessed the input file today
 ;			Fuel load set to ave; Hg emission factor set to AVE
 ; September 17, 2007: for fires in MC region (lat 19-20, long -98 - -100), new NOx, NH3, HCN EFs assigned to forests
 ; 		Fires with Confidence < 20 were removed
 ; October 26, 2007: Renamed this code v3 (version 3). Redid this to run for the week of ContUS fires (for the
 ; 		big CA fires). Edited code in several places for the input file (julday calculation, pathways and files,
 ; 		got rid of the confidence part (see above) b/c input file didn't include confidence.
 ; Feb. 07, 2008: Edited code to run the 2007 fire emissions for Gabi Pfister. INcluded the removal of fires
 ; 		with confidence < 20. Corrected for julian day/time
 ; 		edited order on input variables
 ; Sept. 05, 2008: Edited to rerun emissions for 2002-2006 for Bob Yokelson
